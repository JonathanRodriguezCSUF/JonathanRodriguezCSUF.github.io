I am a computer science major who will hopefully graduate with a Bachelor's Degree in 2027

## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 6 was really fun to do because it gives me a glimpse of how to make code for programs that would lead up to making video games.

Lab 9 was fun because it helped me learn how to connect files to others with just a few lines of code.

Lab 12 is fun because it taught me how to code RNG and animations, which can also be used for video games I’d like to make in the future.
