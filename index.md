## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 6

It was about using if statements and making std::vector<std::string> types. It was really fun to do because it gives me a glimpse of how to make code for programs that would lead up to making video games. Like when I learned how to program Blackjack in the assignment. With this knowledge, I can make other card games like rummy, Texas Hold'em, or even just Go Fish.

Lab 9

It was about writing code that read from a file, writes to a file and handles I/O files. It was fun because it helped me learn how to connect files to others with just a few lines of code, which can be essential to creating certain models and paths for video game mechanics. With this knowledge, I can make code to switch playable characters, initiate gameplay mechanics and even make a customization feature withing the game itself.

Lab 12

This lab was about making code that creates animations, uses library functions and randomly generating numbers. This was really fun to do because it taught me how to code RNG and animations, which can also be used for video games I’d like to make in the future. With RNG, I can make a radius of where bullets will go within a reticle when a gun is shot. I can also make a few luck based minigames like in Mario Party. I can even use the animation code to animate sprites and colors.
